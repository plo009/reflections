Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    A fork is a clone on GitHub of a repository on GitHub. 
    You can clone a online repository to your local machine or a local repository to a different location on your machine
    A branch is kind of like a clone such that you can work on new or experimental features on the branch and not change the master branch, you can also merge two branches together to combine the features on different branches.
